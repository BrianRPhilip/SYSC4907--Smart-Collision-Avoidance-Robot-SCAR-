SYSC 4907 Project - SCAR(Smart collision avoiding robotics)

Created (October 8th) - Due for Sunday, October 13th

General note - To make sure we are all on the same page, download openCV 4.1.1 (https://opencv.org/releases/). We are using python 3.7.
(https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). This comes with a great platform known as jupyter notebook. We should code
here for modularizing and testing out code as we go (It's basically an IDE). We can then either share links or upload it here on Github.
