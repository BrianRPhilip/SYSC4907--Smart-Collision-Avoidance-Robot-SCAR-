Brian - detecting lines in image and dealing with distance from line and how to stay in between them
Adam - detecting objects in image from pi camera (can also use camera on 2 to detect objects maybe? still in research stage)
Shivanshi and Shaviyo - detecting car in image from camera on top. How we detect the car in the images and seperate it from other objects
                        in the room. How to 2D map our findings and maybe communicate with the server on where the car is for better
