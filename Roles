Created (October 8th) - Due for Sunday, October 13th

General note - To make sure we are all on the same page, download openCV 4.1.1 (https://opencv.org/releases/). We are using python 3.7.
(https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). This comes with a great platform known as jupyter notebook. We should code
here for modularizing and testing out code as we go (It's basically an IDE). We can then either share links or upload it here on Github. 

Shivanshi - create the motor code. Think tank. Just need the car to move forward, right, and left. Point is to coordinate the motors. 
We can later write up a script to demo the car moving using this. use (https://github.com/UCTRONICS/UCTRONICS_Smart_Robot_Car_RaspberryPi#graphical-programming)
to get a visual understanding of what we need. There is likely already a prebuilt setup to this. Check and make sure.
Adam - create a kill switch for the RC car. If you have extra time you can read into how to processes the images we are getting for the
following week (https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/da8/tutorial_table_of_content_imgproc.html).
Shaviyo - get car up to date. connect to wifi (consider getting a router and making the system a local based system for maximum speed). 
create test modules to make sure the all sensors are connected properly and is transmitting the right data to the driver board. Connect pi
to wifi.
Brian -create the client-server system for transmitting video to computer to be processed with openCV later.
